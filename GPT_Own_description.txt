I'm working on my bachelor project where we train a deep learning model on chest X-rays images to generate both a free-text radiology report and a label.
The code base consists of five main files
data.py, model.py, train.py, evaluate.py and visualize.py
Because we work on HPC we have also created two additional scripts to work faster which supports command-line interface and config saving. 
run_pipeline.py and run_hpc.sh

The data loader reads a csv file at the path "/zhome/44/7/187366/Bachelor_project/Bachelor_project/hpc/HPC_AP_url_label_50000.csv"
Which has the columns
subject_id,study_id,dicom_id,urls,txt_urls,Pneumonia,pneumonia_label
1 example is 
11941242,50000014,dffc8ab2-ff37704f-2fb29e6d-51e08075-88bca914,/work3/s224228/physionet.org/files/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.1.0/files/p11/p11941242/s50000014/dffc8ab2-ff37704f-2fb29e6d-51e08075-88bca914.jpg,/work3/s224228/physionet.org/files/mimic-cxr/2.1.0/files/p11/p11941242/s50000014.txt,-1.0,2

The data however is stored at "/work3/s224228/" which is also the place where i save each run of the pipeline.

I prefer only having to run the script "run_hpc.sh" once and then add all the decisions to the command line interface and saving them in the configs

When outputting code you have two options:
1. outputting the whole code cell, so i can easily copy and paste the whole file
2. If its small changes i want you to tell which file to change, what lines and into what.
ex: in data.py change "a=2, b=5, c=a+d" into "a=2, b=5, c=a+b"
