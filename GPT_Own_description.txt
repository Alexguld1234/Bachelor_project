I'm working on my bachelor project where we train a deep learning model on chest X-rays images to generate both a free-text radiology report and a label.
The code base consists of five main files
data.py, radtex_model.py, train.py, evaluate.py and visualize.py
Because i want to make it work by running only one script and to use command line interface (CLI) we have made a 6. file called
run_pipeline.py, which main purpose is to call all the functions and have CLI for everything from the main files and specify where to save configs and such.
Because i also want to be able to run it on HPC, i have also made 
run_hpc.sh, which is specific to DTU HPC and calls the run_pipeline.py with all the CLI i want.
We have added a CLI for "setup", because we either run it locally or on HPC, which also changes where the files are located.
When running locally i use CLI in the terminal.

The files are loaded from a csv called "Final_AP_url_label_50000.csv", which is located in the same folder as the rest of the files. An example is 
subject_id,study_id,dicom_id,local_urls,local_txt_urls,hpc_urls,hpc_txt_urls,Pneumonia,pneumonia_label
