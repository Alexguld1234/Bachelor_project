 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with congestive heart failure, presenting status
 post fall, with right perihilar ""infiltrate"" on outside hospital chest
 radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest are provided.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is noted.  There is minimal peribronchial cuffing with trace
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are likely
 small bilateral pleural effusions and/or pleural thickening.  Numerous
 surgical clips are noted throughout the mediastinum and upper abdomen. 
 Scattered pleural calcifications are present, left greater than right.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement and trace interstitial pulmonary edema
 along with cardiomegaly, suggests mild decompensated congestive heart failure.
 
 2. Given the extensive chronic findings, CT should be considered if there is
 further clinical concern for pneumonia.

 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 9:35 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There has been interval placement of endotracheal tube, which has its tip 3.7
 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is again seen coursing below the
 diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Overall lung volumes remain stable,
 but there is indistinctness of the pulmonary vascularity suggestive of
 worsening interstitial pulmonary edema.  More focal patchy opacities at both
 bases, left greater than right, may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia
 cannot be entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural thickening is
 again seen.  Possible small bilateral layering effusions.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning
 between studies.

 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 Indistinct prominent pulmonary vascularity suggests mild fluid overload.  The
 lungs are hyperinflated.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are suspected.  In
 addition, referring medial right lower lobe, and perhaps with medial left
 lower lobe opacity as well, there is a fairly confluent opacity suggestiveof
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting, although substantial
 atelectasis could be considered.  Fissures appear thickened.  Findings are new
 since the recent prior examination.

 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 2 hours prior, there is been
 interval placement of a left-sided IJ central venous catheter which terminates
 near the confluence of the left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  An enteric tube
 terminates within the gastric body.  Bibasilar opacities likely reflect
 atelectasis, although there is some asymmetry with increased opacification at
 the left base and a small pleural effusion, possibly suggesting the presence
 of a pneumonia.  Mild cardiomegaly is mildly increased, but without pulmonary
 vascular congestion or pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal hilar silhouettes
 are otherwise normal.

 There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads again terminating in the
 right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are probably unchanged.  Superimposed on background volume loss and
 band-like opacity in the posterior left lower lobe is increased volume loss

 trace pleural effusion is also difficult to exclude on the left but not
 definitely present.  Elsewhere, the lungs remain clear.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased volume loss in opacity at the left lung base. Whether this may
 represent developing pneumonia or worsening atelectasis superimposed on
 chronic scarring is uncertain and should be correlated with clinical findings.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates at the junction of the SVC and right
 atrium.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated as a result
 appearing mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contour is similar.  The hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular structures is present
 without overt pulmonary edema.  There are patchy opacities in the lung bases,
 potentially atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  Previously

 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited study as result of low lung volumes.  Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases may reflect atelectasis but infection or aspiration cannot be excluded

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with leukocytosis and history of CLL,
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is retrocardiac opacity that likely reflects patient's known hiatal
 hernia.  However, there is an asymmetric right infrahilar opacity when
 compared to the prior exam.  This likely reflects infection versus aspiration.
 There are bilateral interstital opacites present as well.   No pleural
 effusions or pneumothoraces are seen.  The heart is slightly enlarged.  Mitral
 annular calcifications noted.  Aortic arch calcifications are noted.  There is
 no evidence of pneumoperitoneum.  Partial visualization of plate and screw
 fixation of the left humerus is seen fixating the surgical neck fracture of
 the humerus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in right infrahilar opacity concerning for infection
 versus aspiration.  Follow up radiography may be helpful to confirm this;
 however, this appearance may be part of a more generalized pattern of
 pulmonary edema without an additional process.
 
 2.  Findingsl consistent with mild to moderate pulmonary edema.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Lower GI bleed, tracheostomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient is rotated somewhat to the right.  Tracheostomy tube is again seen. 
 There is right mid to lower lung opacity which appears decreased since the
 prior study but persists, which could be due to underlying infection and/or
 aspiration.  There is also blunting of the right costophrenic angle, which may
 be due to a pleural effusion.  There is a nodular opacity projecting over the
 left lower hemithorax, which likely represents nipple shadow.  The aorta
 remains tortuous.  The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged.  There is mild left
 base atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right base opacity and blunting of the right costophrenic angle
 may be due to combination of consolidation and pleural effusion. 
 Consolidation may be due to infection and/or aspiration.

 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Perihilar
 edema appears similar on the left allowing for differences in technique
 between the studies, but there is an increasing area of confluent opacity in
 the right ___- and infrahilar regions.  It is uncertain whether this
 represents asymmetrical edema or a secondary process such as infectious
 pneumonia.  Moderate to large right pleural effusion has also increased in
 size.  Small left pleural effusion appears similar as well as a patchy area of
 atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Nausea and vomiting.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery. 
 The heart is normal in size.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.
 The chest is hyperinflated.  There is a new confluent posterior opacity in the
 left lower lobe with a bulging contour anteriorly.  This appearance is not
 entirely specific but is suggestive of a pleural effusion, potentially with
 loculation as a part of it.  However, other etiologies including confluent
 consolidation with pleural effusion or even potentially malignancy are not
 excluded by this examination.  A thick flowing anterior osteophyte is
 unchanged along the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Pleural-based left lower lobe opacity with a bulging anterior contour. 
 Differential considerations include a pleural effusion with large loculated
 component, versus consolidation with a bulging contour and pleural effusion
 (which could be seen with some infections, for example, Klebsiella pneumonia),
 although even malignancy is not excluded.  Follow-up radiographs are

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary congestion and bilateral
 pleural effusions, more prominent on the right.  The possibility of
 supervening pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
 
 Obliquity of the patient makes it difficult to compare the size of the

 warranted, repeat study without obliquity could be obtained for comparison
 with the prior examination.

 presumed.  In the meantime apparent improvement in left lower lobe
 consolidation is not as marked as one would think since much of the opacity
 previously was due to overlying tubing.  This could, however, represent

 FINDINGS
 
 An ET tube is present, tip 2.7 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present,
 tip extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film.  A right IJ central line is
 present, tip over upper right atrium. 
 
 The heart is not enlarged.  There are dense infiltrates in both lungs, more
 extensive on the left.  There is relative sparing of the outer periphery and
 base of the right lung, with predominantly perihilar distribution on the
 right.  Compared with ___ , there has been   possible slight improvement
 in the right upper lobe, adjacent to the minor fissure.   The left
 hemidiaphragm is less well seen on today's exam, ? due to increased lower lobe
 consolidation versus a small left effusion.  No right-sided effusion is
 identified.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Extensive bilateral infiltrates, slightly worse at the left base
 and possibly slightly improved in the right upper zone. The differential
 diagnosis includes both pulmonary edema and infectious infiltrates.

 INDICATION:  To look for progression of pneumonia and pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright chest view was read in comparison with prior
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral lung volumes remain persistently low with bibasal opacities, left
 side more than right, which is likely atelectasis. However, on the single
 frontal view, differentiation betweeen atelectasis and pneumonia is difficult,
 and should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical history. Mildly
 increased haziness of the lungs with indistinct vascular margins and perihilar
 haze is likely pulmonary edema, which appears mild to moderate. Given low lung
 volumes, severity of pulmonary edema may be exaggerated. Bilateral pleural
 effusions are small and unchanged.  Heart size is normal.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5.8 cm from the carina. Enteric
 tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm and into the stomach, with tip
 off the inferior borders of the film. Moderate enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is demonstrated. Mediastinal contour is prominent superiorly,
 likely due to supine positioning and low lung volumes.  Bilateral perihilar
 opacities, more pronounced on the right, suggests moderate pulmonary edema. 
 More focal opacity in the right upper lobe could reflect infection or
 aspiration. Layering right pleural effusion is also noted and there is likely
 a small left pleural effusion.No displaced fractures are demonstrated.

 Stable substantial cardiac enlargement without pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 There is interval improved pulmonary edema and resolution of patchy right
 basilar infiltrate with focal linear area of left-sided retrocardiac
 opacification.  The nasogastric tube has been removed.  Mediastinal contours
 are stable from previous examination.  Continuous lucency under the diaphragm
 is consistent with pneumoperitoneum secondary to PEG tube.

 Patient has been extubated and lung volumes are low but reasonably well
 maintained.  Heterogeneous opacification in the left lung, particularly
 peripherally could be pneumonia or even pulmonary nodules.  CT scanning would
 be helpful in clarification.  There is also suggestion of left-sided pleural
 thickening, perhaps calcification.  There is no appreciable layering pleural
 effusion.  Right lung is grossly clear.  The heart is normal size. 
 Mediastinal fullness to the right of the lower trachea is probably vascular
 engorgement rather than a large mass since the trachea is not shifted away
 from that side.

 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided atrioventricular pacemaker is obscuring part of right lung base. 
 Mild pulmonary edema is seen with pulmonary vessel cephalisation and
 peribronchovascular cuffing.  Left lower lobe opacity is compatible with
 atelectasis.  Pleural effusion is small if any.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 There is a right jugular line in place with distal end that is hard to see

 Because the patient is not properly positioned, I cannot assess the severity
 of leftward mediastinal shift .  This is important because there is new
 consolidation in the left lower lobe and if there is appreciable leftward
 mediastinal shift and some or all of the consolidation is due to collapse.  If
 there is minimal or no shift, it is more likely pneumonia.  There is new mild
 atelectasis at the right base as well as small bilateral pleural effusions.

 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line terminates in the superior vena cava, inserted via a
 right-sided approach.  An extensive opacity in the left upper lung is quite
 similar.  A large cavitary component within the central part of left upper
 lobe consolidation appears unchanged.  A left-sided pleural effusion appears
 likely decreased.  However, the main change is that there is new patchy
 opacity in the left lower lobe with upward tenting of the left hemidiaphragm
 and volume loss.  A mild-to-moderate lower thoracic compression deformity is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent extensive left upper lobe consolidation including a
 large cavitary component.  Although a left-sided pleural effusion is probably
 reduced, there is increasing parenchymal opacification with volume loss at the
 left base, which may be associated with increased extent of infection. 
 Clinical correlation is suggested.

 Lung volumes have generally improved and the cardiomediastinal silhouette has
 a normal postoperative appearance.  A flame shaped opacity projecting over the
 left upper lung is more obvious following resolution of previous left-sided
 atelectasis and decreasing left pleural effusion.  It was not present
 preoperatively.  It is either loculated pleural fluid or upper lobe
 consolidation.  Because of this location, I cannot attribute it to atelectasis
 and pneumonia is therefore the major concern.
 Right jugular sheath ends just above the thoracic inlet.  No pneumothorax.

 lobe pneumonia from loculated pleural effusion.

 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with tachypnea and labored breathing.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___, CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a marked
 interval increase in bibasilar air space opacities and probable small pleural
 effusions.  The pulmonary vasculature remains normal.  The cardiac silhouette
 is normal in size, and is unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are notable
 only for calcification of the aortic knob.  A left chest two-lead cardiac
 pacemaker is in stable and standard configuration.  There is marked gaseous
 distention of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increase in bibasilar opacities.  Considerations include
 developing pulmonary edema, although the pulmonary vasculature appears normal
 and the heart size is unchanged, making this an atypical appearance for edema.
 Alternatively, developing infection may give this appearance although this
 doesn't fit with the clinical presentation as it would be expected that the
 patient would be very ill if pneumonia were this widespread.
 
 2.  Gaseous distention of the stomach can put the patient at risk for
 aspiration, and decompression of this is recommended.

 There has been interval development of a left lower lobe/retrocardiac opacity,
 possibly with a visualized air bronchogram, which obscures the left
 hemidiaphragm. Additionally, there is loss of definition of the right
 hemidiaphragm. There are also small bilateral pleural effusions. This may
 represent new left lower lobe or possibly bilateral lower lobe aspiration

 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and multiple prior other radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison to the prior radiograph, a single semi-erect portable
 view of the chest demonstrates significantly lower lung volumes.  Bibasilar
 opacities are most consistent with atelectasis, although in the correct
 clinical setting, pneumonia could certainly be considered.  There are possible
 small bilateral pleural effusions.  Patient is status post median sternotomy
 and CABG.  Cardiac size is exaggerated by the AP view as well as the lower
 lung volumes but given these appears relatively stable. Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is present, with possible mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion. No pneumothorax. Heterotopic ossification is again noted along the
 inferior margin of the right glenoid.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes accentuating both pulmonary vasculature as well
 as bibasilar atelectasis.  Underlying pneumonia is certainly a possibility in
 the correct clinical setting. Possible small bilateral pleural effusions.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged and in standard position.  There is again
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema.  Opacification at
 the left base is consistent with volume loss and pleural fluid, though in the
 appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered.  Less prominent atelectasis is seen at the right base.

 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was provided.  A metallic
 stent is seen in the right upper quadrant, likely residing within the CBD. 
 Bibasilar opacities are most compatible with atelectasis.  No free air is seen
 below the right hemidiaphragm.  Given the presence of lower lobe atelectasis,
 the possibility of a superimposed pneumonia is difficult to exclude.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is
 seen.  Bony structures appear intact.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxemia and dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.  Another comparison is a set of radiographs from
 earlier on the same day from an outside hospital.
  
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The course of a right-sided PICC line is difficult to visualize but
 it probably terminates, as before, at the cavoatrial junction.  The patient is
 status post sternotomy and probably coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  Hazy opacification of
 each lung is consistent with pulmonary edema, probably somewhat worse than on
 the prior study, although increased blurring may be due to differences in
 technique to some extent.  In particular, in the left mid lung, there is a
 more conspicuous opacity, but this may be due to rotation compared to the
 prior study.  Pleural effusions are difficult to exclude.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Probably similar findings suggesting pulmonary edema since the
 recent prior study.  In addition, a developing left mid lung opacity, which
 may indicate coinciding infection is doubted but hard to excluded.  If
 developing infection is a possible clinical concern, then follow-up
 radiographs are suggested to reassess.

 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. There are bilateral pleural effusions with overlying
 atelectasis. Prominence of the hila may be due to low volume overload.
 Bibasilar opacities may relate to combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis although underlying consolidation due to infection cannot be
 excluded on this study. The cardiac silhouette appears at least mildly
 enlarged. The aortic knob is calcified.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis in combination with
 prominence of the hila and enlarged cardiac silhouette, could be due to
 CHF/fluid overload in the appropriate clinical setting. Alternatively,
 infectious process is not excluded, nor is underlying hilar adenopathy.
 Suggest repeat after diuresis for further evaluation. .

 INDICATION:  Altered mental status and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A stimulator device again projects over the left hemithorax.  The heart is
 mildly enlarged. The aortic arch shows patchy calcification.  There is a
 moderate interstitial abnormality most consistent with congestive heart
 failure.  In addition there is a slightly bulging posterior basilar opacity
 better depicted on the lateral view likely localizing to the left lower lobe. 
 This, for the most part, probably represents a pleural effusion but coinciding
 atelectasis or pneumonia is not excluded by this examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Findings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Posterior basilar opacity, probably in the left lower lobe, suggesting a
 pleural effusion with atelectasis; however pneumonia not excluded.
 
 Short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful, preferably with PA and
 lateral technique, if feasible.

 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  The pulmonary vascularity is normal.  Lungs remain hyperinflated
 with attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings within the lung apices
 compatible with underlying emphysema.  Streaky airspace opacities are noted in
 the lung bases, which appears progressed when compared to the prior study
 within the left lung base.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Streaky airspace opacities within the lung bases, slightly worse in the left
 lung base when compared to the prior study.  These could reflect areas of
 bibasilar atelectasis but infection particularly in the left lung base cannot
 be excluded.  Emphysema.

 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Lung volumes
 are low.  Patchy opacity in right infrahilar region probably represents a
 combination of patchy atelectasis and adjacent small pleural effusion. 
 Aspiration or an early focus of pneumonia are additional considerations, and
 followup radiographs may be helpful in this regard.  Within the left

 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is detected on this single frontal view.  Lung markings and
 pulmonary vasculature are exaggerated at the lung bases, possibly due to low
 lung volumes and overlying soft tissues.  Heart and mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Suboptimal evaluation of the lung bases due to low lung volumes and absence of
 lateral radiograph without evidence for pneumonia on this single frontal view.

 atelectasis or recent aspiration.  Subsequent chest radiograph, 7:45 p.m.
 available at the time of this review shows that the lower lungs have largely
 cleared, so this should not raise concern for developing pneumonia.

 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Right-sided pacer
 device is noted with single lead terminating in the right ventricle.  Left
 axillary vascular stent is re- identified.  Heart size remains moderately
 enlarged.  Lung volumes are low.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged with
 calcification of the thoracic aorta re- demonstrated.  There is crowding of
 the bronchovascular structures, with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Ill-defined nodular opacity within the right mid lung field is new and may
 reflect a focus of infection.  Additionally bibasilar airspace opacities
 appear progressed compared to the previous exam and could reflect atelectasis
 but infection or aspiration are not excluded.  Small left pleural effusion
 persists, with a component loculated laterally, and is perhaps slightly
 increased compared to the prior study, with the right pleural effusion
 appearing essentially resolved.  There is no pneumothorax.

 Since a recent radiograph of 1 day earlier, widespread bilateral pulmonary
 consolidations have progressed, particularly in the left upper lobe, although
 there has been slight improvement in the left lower lobe appear The right lung
 there is involved to a greater degree than the left.  Findings are most
 suggestive of multifocal pneumonia, although a component of pulmonary edema is

 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___, at 22:14 p.m., an ET tube has been placed.  The tip of
 the tube lies approximately 2.2 cm above the carina, in satisfactory position.
 A nasogastric-type tube is also in place, with tip lying beneath the
 diaphragms at the expected site of the gastric body.  The sideport position is
 difficult to assess due to the patient's anatomy.  
 
 As before, there is marked cardiomegaly.  There is actually improved
 appearance of the left main stem bronchus truncation.  There is again diffuse
 opacity of much of the left lung, with some improved aeration at left lung
 apex, possibly due to change in position versus improvement in a left
 effusion.  
 
 Compared to the prior study, there is new increased opacity in the right upper
 and mid zones in addition to the previously seen opacity at the right base. 
 This could represent worsening of asymmetric edema or of infectious infiltrate
 and appears to also include an increase in a right-sided effusion.
 
 There is an unusual overlapped appearance to the fourth rib laterally,
 equivocal for a non-displaced fracture.  IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes as described.
 2.  Marked cardiomegaly, similar to prior.
 3.  Increased opacity right lung, ? worse asymmetric pulmonary edema or
 worsening infiltrate, together with increase in size of right effusion.
 4.  Improved aeration at the left lung apex, question improvement or
 repositioning of left effusion.
 5.  Double contour of the left fourth rib laterally, question artifact versus
 non-displaced fracture. Attention to this area on followup films is
 recommended.

 Moderate to severe enlargement of cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated.  The
 mediastinal contours are stable, with atherosclerotic calcification of the
 thoracic aorta noted.  The hilar contours remain enlarged, with perihilar
 haziness and vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary edema,
 findings which appear slightly progressed when compared to the radiograph
 obtained earlier the same day.  More focal opacity within the peripheral
 aspect of the left lung base appears more pronounced compared to the prior
 exam, and infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax is identified.  There is no free subdiaphragmatic air. 
 Multiple clips are seen along the left lateral chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, progressed when compared to the radiograph obtained
 earlier the same day.  More focal opacity within the periphery of the left
 lung base also appears more pronounced than on the prior study, and is
 non-specific, but could reflect an area of infection or aspiration.  Follow up
